> out of topic technical question am a self taught fullstack web/app developer  I learned dart/flutter as my first language  am willing to learn angular 10 / node.js and or deno and nest.js  the question is can I learn typescript right away without learning JavaScript ??

> I made a bad joke and now I might lose my job, what should I do?

> Hi, Fredrik! As you say that companies do not care about the number of PL you know,  but rather about that one specific language they use, would you agree that one shouldn't list all the languages he knows in his CV when applying for a certain position in a specific company, but rather stress the knowledge of the language they use? I am asking it because there is an opinion that it doesn't matter whether or not you know a certain language if you know some. For example, a C++ or C# developer could very well be taken on a C# position and vice versa. Therefore, does it really make sense to list all the languages you know (if you know several) in a CV? And if the assumption above is true, does it make sense to learn any other languages (except maybe JS, which stands apart in a way) if switching is such a no-brainer (as some people say)?

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
