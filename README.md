> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
