## Pending questions

> I have a question. Is there a projectsize that determines wether or not you need a backend framework? Is doing a project with no framework at all in some cases a good idea?

> If you already have a job, how do you change languages, frameworks, technologies, without needing to apply to position with significantly less seniority and pay? What I mean is, how do you develop your career to avoid being pegged into a specific role the entire time without needing to start your career all over? How did you switch from backend to frontend, and did you need to take a pay cut?

> Fred I quit my first dev job after 2 years. It was mostly due to burn out (the burnout was a result of me not saying no enough to scope creep, accepting tight deadlines and giving bad estimates that required me to work a lot extra in my free time to meet) I did not give my company a 2 weeks notice but I did help transition my projects over to the next dev. It's been about 6 months since I quit and I am feeling ready to start applying. How in the world do I explain why I left my last job and not look like a red flag? Do I just say that quarantine fatigue was really sitting in and I wanted to take some time for myself and also learn new technologies (my last company was a wordpress agency)? I attend to begin applying with a stronger understanding of javascript under my belt + 2 months of experience with react. These are both new things I have picked up since quitting. I'm just worried the way I left my last company even though I was there for 2 years could hold me back from new jobs so I guess my question is how does someone who quit their job in a bad way go to the next company without seeming like a bad hire (and I accept if there is no way around this but to be labeled a bad hire and learn from it)

> Fredrik you are spot on! 100% agree with literally this entire video. Developer apathy is a real thing and i think the idea that you pointed out of "Solving the problem from within" rather than from outside (regarding programmer productivity) is great insight. Do you think Scrum techniques can help here?

> What do you think would be the best time to walk away? Is 3 years exp as a software developer( different projects, different tech stacks), A good time to shop around? Due to having differing tech stacks being used by different projects, I feel as if I do not possess the needed experience to be a intermediate level developer in any of the tech stacks I have experienced. In a different phrasing, when you can say, that your market value has increased as compared to when you were a junior?

> What do you think is the most important: how we take / see a certain situation or the situation environment itself? For example: if I work with a co-worker who is stressing / pressuring me constantly, should we consider that he / she is a problem or I as an individual am the problem because I fail to just detach and stop taking things so seriously? Most of times I have heard a saying that goes along these lines: reality is not the problem, the problem is how you see reality within yourself...

> Hi, Fredrik. I am a long time subscriber and regular watcher of your vlog. I need your help and advice. I am on my first job and I am doing React development in a small IT company for about a year. I am not unhappy at this company but it is very small. The good thing is that I work on projects from scratch. The bad thing is that I don't work on any big projects. Now the company is finishing the React project and they have asked me to do Java work. I know basic Java and would love to learn it better. But does switching languages so early in my career before mastering one, hurt my long term career prospects? I am scared of becoming a full stack developer that knows a little bit of everything but is a master of nothing. I feel like I should leave this company and look for a bigger firm where I can do large scale React projects. Is leaving after one year in my first job too early?  What do you think?

> Hey Fredrik, do you think the frontend community will ever developer best practices the same way the backed community has ? Or do you think that’s impossible because frontend development is inherently chaotic ?

> Hey Frederick, I don’t know if you’ve made a video covering this topic, but how would I stay motivated or avoid being bogged down from either being ignored from companies that I have applied to or being rejected?

> Hi Frederick, I have a question for you. why technology giants (think google, amazon, facebook, ibm, etc) mostly use java and very few use .NET ?

> I'm a software engineer who works mostly on Java. What can I start doing now that will help me in my career in long run?

> Am I learning too slow that I know dependency injection, decoupling, weak/soft reference and code coverage only after 2+ years of work experience?

> How do I make my life more interesting as a software engineer?

> I am a software developer, I have all the knowledge about my work, but I am not timely efficient, I do it but it takes me extra time than other do. What should I do?

> I just quit my software developer job to try to become a singer. My friends and parents don't support me. What should I do?

> Am I a bad Software Engineer if I can not implement sorting algorithms from the top of my head?

> I am not a detail-oriented person but I like how software development can change people's lives, would I enjoy coding?

> I've heard that "Separation of Concerns" opposes "Dependency Injection". If so, how?

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
