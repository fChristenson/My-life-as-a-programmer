> I want to quit my job and plan to open own software company. I want to know how to get new software project for my company?

> Hi Fredrik, What certificates would u recommend to new programmers before they apply for their first job? I dont have a degree, so certificates would mean something for a junior level position. I had a look at your linkedin profile and saw u had CS50 listed. I completed Java Nanodegree from Udacity(took me 20 days) and Im planning on taking CS50 from edx. Im mostly a backend guy and I can see myself in the future creating apis and microservices in java/go. The part I enjoy the most is optimizing (ha, junior) data/persistence layer and queries.  I also have some competitive programming experience, shitty rating tho. Thanks in advance!

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
