## Pending questions

> Thank you so much, Fredrik! You mentioned 1 to 5 years, which begs the question, how to direct efforts to get rock star status within 1 year? Should you become Jack of all trades, or specialize (eg. in frontend, go deep in React, Next.js). I tend to go with the second, but I'm not sure...

> Fredric, how can I become full stack engineer the fastest way? I have been working for one year as backend engineer and I am thinking of joining start up where I would be able to work on frontend, backend, devops

> Hi Fredrik. How useful do you think is knowing multithreading , concurrency as a Junior developer ? As I found it to be quite difficult to learn especially for people like me who dont get the chance to use it at work. From my understanding , that kind optimization is rarely the thing we need for small application ?  will I ever need to be good at multi, concurrency at all ?

> Thank you for the video! Got the point about ML. But more generally, how about CS? If you taught yourself building things, and just using higher level technologies, do you think it's worth in the long term investing the time to learn the fundamentals of CS? Probably a topic for a video? : )

> Portfolio sites are a popular enough way for junior developers to show off their skills and improve their chances of getting the first job. Do midlevel developers still do portfolio sites and is it a good idea?

> Any updates on your thoughts on blockchains, cryptocurrencies and careers in this space since your last video on the subject?

> Do you learn a new language every year. ?

> Hi Fredrik, been listening for you for quite some time now and I really appriciate the time and effort you do. Huge help for people like me in the start of my career. I have a question, got offered an position at my current internship(digital agency). My role as an intern is .NET developer. I am currently studying a higher vocational education(.NET utvecklare, Stockholm). The agency offered me this offer with the clause that I learn Wordpress too as they really need Wordpress developers, so I will have a mix of .NET and WP work. I have no problems learning WP and I think it might be fun since I enjoy webdev. My question is will this hurt my career long term as a .NET developer? Or should I just take it and roll with it just to get my "foot in the door" since im a junior dev?

> ok Fredrick What do you think about companies seeing their devs as a cost centre?

> How do you practice backend skills?

> Hi Frefrik! I am working for the company on the implementation of a new ERP system for more than 2 years now. My job is mainly to migrate data between the old and new system. I also worked on a few modifications of the new system where I had the opportunity to program business logic and UX a bit. Apart from that, I maintain the old system and support the users. I briefly deal with everything that the current situation requires (Excel, SSRS, System integrations, Windows etc.)
The main reason why I was tempted to take this job was the information about the knowledge of C # in the requirements. I thought it was a great opportunity to deepen my programming knowledge.
Unfortunately, the reality is disappointing, and so I have a few questions that may become the topic of a podcast series. BTW I like them very much!

> 1. What if the requirements and scope of duties presented in the job advertisement and in the interview do not match what I have to face with in my job? Instead of programming, I do a lot of other things that make me unable to be good at all of them.

> 2. I noticed that I am becoming the only person in the company who can do certain things. At the beginning I felt proud and satisfied, but now I know that it has a very bad effect on my work life balance. People quickly get used to the fact that in any situation they will pull out the phone, call a superhero who will definitely help. I don't want to be a man who can't afford vacation.

> 3. I was hired as a junior and have nobody to learn from. I have one friend, but he is like mr. everything, more analyst than developer. Apart from him, there are no other people in the company who could help me solve certain problems, so I have to do many things myself. It often happens that I am not sure if I am doing my job in the right way and I am afraid that one day the company may suffer serious losses because of it. I feel real fear as like my life is in danger. Wired but seriously.

> 4. I've been in this project for a long time and I think I contribute a lot to it, but it's not something I would like to do all the time. I actually don't fell happy and fullfiled with the task I'm getting and what is worse I know there is noone else who can do it instead. Many things do not suit me, but my propriety, feeling of duty and responsibility do not allow me to leave the company.

> Hello Frederik, can I ask if you have wife and children? I assume not but might be wrong. I in a situation where my work life is thriving and my girlfriend wants to start a family.  Not sure how to handle this one as short-term this will kill my progress in programming field and long-term it might be a good balance from work. What do you think?

> I am a software developer, I have all the knowledge about my work, but I am not timely efficient, I do it but it takes me extra time than other do. What should I do?

> I just quit my software developer job to try to become a singer. My friends and parents don't support me. What should I do?

> Am I a bad Software Engineer if I can not implement sorting algorithms from the top of my head?

> I am not a detail-oriented person but I like how software development can change people's lives, would I enjoy coding?

> I've heard that "Separation of Concerns" opposes "Dependency Injection". If so, how?

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
