> I'm a software engineer and as I grow older I find myself being less efficient and willing to work, debug, modify code that I haven't written. Are there other engineers that have felt the same way?

> I have to develop a big project of software for a company I have never did this type projects. Should I go for it or not or guide me what to do?

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
