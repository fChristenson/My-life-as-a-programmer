> Hi, Fredrik. I am a long time subscriber and regular watcher of your vlog. I need your help and advice. I am on my first job and I am doing React development in a small IT company for about a year. I am not unhappy at this company but it is very small. The good thing is that I work on projects from scratch. The bad thing is that I don't work on any big projects. Now the company is finishing the React project and they have asked me to do Java work. I know basic Java and would love to learn it better. But does switching languages so early in my career before mastering one, hurt my long term career prospects? I am scared of becoming a full stack developer that knows a little bit of everything but is a master of nothing. I feel like I should leave this company and look for a bigger firm where I can do large scale React projects. Is leaving after one year in my first job too early?  What do you think?

> Hey Fredrik, do you think the frontend community will ever developer best practices the same way the backed community has ? Or do you think that’s impossible because frontend development is inherently chaotic ?

> Hey Frederick, I don’t know if you’ve made a video covering this topic, but how would I stay motivated or avoid being bogged down from either being ignored from companies that I have applied to or being rejected?

> Hi Frederick, I have a question for you. why technology giants (think google, amazon, facebook, ibm, etc) mostly use java and very few use .NET ?

> I'm a software engineer who works mostly on Java. What can I start doing now that will help me in my career in long run?

> Am I learning too slow that I know dependency injection, decoupling, weak/soft reference and code coverage only after 2+ years of work experience?

> How do I make my life more interesting as a software engineer?

> I am a software developer, I have all the knowledge about my work, but I am not timely efficient, I do it but it takes me extra time than other do. What should I do?

> I just quit my software developer job to try to become a singer. My friends and parents don't support me. What should I do?

> Am I a bad Software Engineer if I can not implement sorting algorithms from the top of my head?

> I am not a detail-oriented person but I like how software development can change people's lives, would I enjoy coding?

> I've heard that "Separation of Concerns" opposes "Dependency Injection". If so, how?

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
