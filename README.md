> Hi Fredrik! Could you spill some light on how should a CV of a senior software engineer differ from that of a mid-level SE and a junior? Or rather, how can I as a recruiter figure out that someone is not quite who he/she claims to be from his/her CV? What mistakes do SE usually do trying to look better than they are? Or, looking at it from a different perspective, how can I avoid the mistakes of inexperienced job seekers and better reflect my level of experience? If I try to answer my own question, I would suggest that junior developers make emphasis on tools, languages, libs and frameworks they presumably know even if those are very basic things which every developer should know, such as git, make/cmake, google test, bash scripting and so on. But I can imagine that it wouldn't look suitable for a senior developer to list these basic tools in his CV? So what would a senior developer state instead to emphasize his seniority? Thank you in advance!

> Hi Fredrik, What certificates would u recommend to new programmers before they apply for their first job? I dont have a degree, so certificates would mean something for a junior level position. I had a look at your linkedin profile and saw u had CS50 listed. I completed Java Nanodegree from Udacity(took me 20 days) and Im planning on taking CS50 from edx. Im mostly a backend guy and I can see myself in the future creating apis and microservices in java/go. The part I enjoy the most is optimizing (ha, junior) data/persistence layer and queries.  I also have some competitive programming experience, shitty rating tho. Thanks in advance!

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
