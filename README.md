> How would you go about teaching juniors how to solve problems with googling and reading documentation ? I’ve noticed that a lot junior developers that have flooded the market recently learned how to code through video tutorials or online coding platforms that hold their hands the entire time. A lot of them are intimidated by digging deep into documentation in order to solve problems. They constantly need a senior to answer simple questions that they could have easily found by reading documentation.
